# Cpp-Prime-Manipulator
A small program I made when learning c++ that takes the product of any two prime numbers and brute forces the original two primes.
## Background
Prime numbers are the basis of RSA encryption. In this encryption method two large prime numbers are selected. These two prime numbers act as the private key.
The two primes are then multiplied together and their product acts as the public key.
## This Program
This program prompts for the product of two primes (acting as the public key) and bruteforces the original two prime numbers (acting as the private key).
